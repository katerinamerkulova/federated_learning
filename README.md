# Federated Learning

Disclaimer: This script does not exactly federated learning, but distributed, since it only runs on one CPU machine with 3 replicas.

To execute script:
1. Download the repository.
2. Via terminal in script folder:
```bash
$ pip -r install requirements.txt
$ python distributed.py
```
3. There are a few new files: "model_summary.txt" with model architecture info, "model_loss_and_accuracy.txt" with model performance, "model_training.png" with graph of learning process.
