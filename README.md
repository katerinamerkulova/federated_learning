Disclaimer: This script does not exactly federated learning, but distributed, since it only runs on one CPU machine.

To execute script:
1. Download the repository.
2. Via CMD in script folder: python distributed.py
3. There are a few new files: "model_summary.txt" with model topology info, "model_loss_and_accuracy.txt" with model performance, "model_training.png" with graph of learning process.
